name: singing_bowl_tuner
description: >-
  A highâ€‘accuracy realâ€‘time tuner for singing bowls built with Flutter.  It
  measures the fundamental frequency (f0), maps it to the nearest note in the
  chromatic scale, reports the deviation in cents, and records measurement
  history.  The app uses native audio input and custom digital signal
  processing via Platform Channels to achieve low latency and high accuracy.
